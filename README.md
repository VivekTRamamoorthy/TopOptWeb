# Structural topology optimisation code in a web page

Use the app at [VivekTRamamoorthy.github.io/TopOptWeb](https://VivekTRamamoorthy.github.io/TopOptWeb)

## Algorithm

This javascript app performs compliance minimisation topology optimisation in the web browser to solve a simple beam fixed at one end with a load at the other. The algorithm used is the popular solid-isotropic material with penalisation method popularised by Ole Sigmund. 

## Paint and erase shapes
The app allows the user to manually edit the shape by paint and erase tools during the algorithm to enforce specific attributes in the final solution. 

## Mobile friendly
The app is tested to work well on google Chrome for mobile.
